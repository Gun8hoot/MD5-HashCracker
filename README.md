# Hash-Cracker

- **Hash-Cracker** is a kind of a toolbox to crack and encode MD5 hashing algorithm
- Cracking can take a lot of time (With my trash computer cracking the word "root" took 30 seconds but "print" took 28 minutes)
- The script is not designed to be used in real-life situations. I created this script to challenge myself and learn more about python programming and brute force attack.
- This script should ***not be used*** *for illegal purpose*.

## How to use ?
### Linux
---
- Download the repo from github
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gun8hoot/MD5-ToolBox.git
```
- Go to "./MD5-ToolBox" folder
```sh
cd ./MD5-ToolBox
```
- Execute the main.py file
```sh
python3 ./main.py {-hash} {-str}  {-m}

#Or

chmod u+x ./main.py
./main.py {-hash} {-str}  {-m}
```
- Select the module you want use by typing:
1. Dictionary brute force
2. Simple brute force attack
3. Encode a word to MD5 hash
4. Leave the script

### Windows
---
- Download the repo from github
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gun8hoot/MD5-ToolBox.git
```
- Go to ".\MD5-ToolBox" folder
```sh
cd ./MD5-ToolBox
```
- Execute the main.py file
```sh
py -3 ./main.py
```
- Two type of attack is available:
1. Dictionary (`-tp dictionary`)
2. Simple bruteforce attack (`-tp bruteforce`)
